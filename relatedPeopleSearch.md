Each full name should be searched for like `"[full name]"" "linkedin.com/in"` to get all people that are related to this person.

Output: get all results including exhaustive, and find information about all other people that show up besides the name we searched for.

NOTE: Works pretty good with `"wijnand karsens" "linkedin.com/in"` at least, I am sure it will work well for more people, unless the name is too common, then we need to include the location and maybe even the profession of that person as well.
