Input: Search for `"[skill]" "[name]" "[location]" "linkedin.com/in/" with quotes so you don't get duplicates among searches. Search for first and last names, sorted on popularity.

NB: Ensure we get past the first 4 pages with the SERP api!

Output: Each google result should now have a unique person profile. Now, we can get every individual in a niche. For every name-location-pair we find, store all information we find for it on that result that belong to that name.
