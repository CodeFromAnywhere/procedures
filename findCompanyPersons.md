Input: Each company can be searched for like `"[company name]" "linkedin.com/in"` because it will yield all employees at the company, and people that worked there in the past. Very useful information.

Output: All information can augment the `company:string[]` property on the `Person` model

Why:

1. Find the decision makers or the people most relevant to a specific thing
2. Figure out who knows each other, as people in the same company often know each other. Useful if you can't reach someone, or if you can't reach the company itself.
