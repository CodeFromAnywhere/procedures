1. Take a company or person with full name.

2. Search google for `"[name]" "blog OR articles OR news"`

3. If any, find a pattern of the url domain where blogs can be found

4. Now search with that pattern in mind `site:[domainname] "[pattern]"` or simply `site:[domainname] blog` if there's no clear pattern besides domain name.

5. Visit every blog you find and gather the resulting pages as markdown documents.
