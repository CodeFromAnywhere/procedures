Based on a person's name, location, and company, find images on google images for this person.

If we can know the gender and maybe age beforehand, or at least do an educated guess, that's a big win for accuracy.

Use a image to text model to verify whether or not the image really seems to be a human with the perceived details.

If there are multiple different humans, make an educated guess based on the most common one.

If there doesn't end up to be high certainty (<90%) - make sure to reject
